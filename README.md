# AI-Driven-Personal-Financial-Assistant

Use machine learning to create a personal financial plan for the user. 

## Description

This application’s primary purpose is to apply AI and machine learning models to provide users with the best personalized financial advice. The application will analyze a person’s financial data such as expenses, savings, and income, and offer a customized recommendation for budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. The front end will begin with a login page where the user must create an account if they have not already. Next, the user will be asked to submit any information about their current finances, like bank statements, credit card statements, or income statements. Next, we will utilize machine learning to categorize expenses and determine the user's spending patterns. Furthermore, the goal will also be to inform the user where the user can reduce expenses. The user will have the choice of picking the option of budgeting tool, saving recommendations, or debt management. The budgeting tool will set a budget for a category. For example, if the user exceeds the amount they should have spent on groceries an alert would be provided to the user about his current plan. The saving recommendation would be based on the user’s income and provide a plan on how much the user should spend or save. Based on the time limit I would also like to provide predictive Analytics. This is about predicting future financial scenarios and helping users make the best decisions. The biggest part of this application will be security. We will be dealing with some extremely sensitive documents. Therefore, security will be a huge part of this project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
